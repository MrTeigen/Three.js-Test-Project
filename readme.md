# Three.js Test Project

This project is a simple demonstration of using Three.js to create and animate 3D objects in a web browser. The project features an interactive menu that allows users to control various aspects of the animation, such as the velocity, size, and rotation speed of the objects.

## Features

- **3D Objects**: The project includes two 3D objects - an Earth sphere and a die. Users can toggle between these objects using the menu.
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can adjust the velocity, size, and rotation speed of the objects using sliders in the menu.
- **Collision Detection**: The objects bounce off the edges of the screen, reversing their velocity upon collision.
- **Smooth Rotation**: The die smoothly rotates to the closest face when the animation is stopped.
- **Responsive Design**: The project adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click the "Menu" button to open the interactive menu.
3. Use the sliders to adjust the velocity, size, and rotation speed of the objects.
4. Toggle between the Earth sphere and the die using the radio buttons.
5. Click the "Stop" button to stop the animation and smoothly rotate the die to the closest face. Click "Resume" to continue the animation.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the web browser.
- **HTML**: The structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Basic styling for the menu and buttons.
- **JavaScript**: The logic for animating the 3D objects and handling user interactions.
